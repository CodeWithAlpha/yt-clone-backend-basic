# YouTube Clone Backend

This project contains a basic backend implementation for a YouTube-style application built with TypeScript, Express and MongoDB.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the development server using nodemon
- `npm run build` – compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm start` – run the compiled server from the `dist` folder

## Directory Structure

- `src/` – TypeScript source files
- `public/` – static assets and temporary upload directory
- `dist/` – compiled JavaScript output (generated after running `npm run build`)

Make sure to create an `.env` file with your environment variables such as database URI and JWT secrets.
